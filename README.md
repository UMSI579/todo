# Step by step description
## Step 1: Copy the markup from PS4 (todo list)
- Remove IDs
- Change 'class' to 'className

## Step 2: Make a TodoItem component
- These items will eventually be rendered based on an array of "todos", but for now lets hard code two of them
- For now, just display the timestamp that is passed in. We can worry about formatting later.
